# Linear Models and Regularization

This Project involves implementing linear models, exploring regularization techniques, and analyzing their performance.

## Objective
To explore linear regression and binary classification techniques with regularization and gradient-based optimization, while evaluating their performance through various experiments.

## Problem Statements
### Linear Regression Tasks
1. Generate data matrices and target vectors for regression.
2. Compute solutions using pseudo-inverse and gradient descent.
3. Investigate the impact of noise and regularization parameters on model performance.
4. Analyze weight behavior under L1, L2, and Elastic Net penalties.

### Logistic Regression Tasks
1. Generate classification data and train a logistic regression model.
2. Analyze model performance with respect to noise and regularization parameters.
